# *Contact List* Quiz


## Introduction

In this exercise, you have to implement a product catalog for an online shop. You are free to decide whether you use *server-side rendering* of HTML pages or a RESTful Web API with a *single-page app* client based on JavaScript/TypeScript.

Design the Web UI as you like. Using a CSS framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is recommended, but no mandatory.

1. Everybody has to do his/her best to come up with a solution.

1. Earn one point for your grade if you create a *GitHub Issue* in your *GitHub Classroom* containing a link to the Web API that I can test over the Internet. If you need help finding a free hosting service for your ASP.NET solution, [contact me](mailto:r.stropek@htl-perg.ac.at).

   * View a list of all products.
